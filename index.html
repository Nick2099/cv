      Programming has been my hobby for many years. I stopped doing that because I didn’t have enough free time.
      But I was always near. I was the contact person to software company that did programs for the wholesale/retail company where I worked.
      In addition to presenting ideas for program improvements, I have often developed completely new functionalities and elaborated how programs should work.
      There have been many changes in my professional life over the years. As I finally had some free time, I started programming again. It would be really nice if one day I could work as a programmer.    </p>
